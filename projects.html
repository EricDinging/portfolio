	    	<h2>Light Strider, July 2021</h2>
	    	<p>
	    		This is a team project, a web game written in ELM. You are going to direct light beams through obstacles, using mirrors and light splitters. This game uses randomness and graph algorithms extensively. Try it. It's fun!

	        <h2>China May Day Mathematical Contest in Modeling Project, May 2022</h2>
	        <p>
	          I led a team to build a gray comprehensive evaluation model and a neural network prediction model with Softmax classifier in Python and Matlab, based on a dataset of a city’s fire alarm systems (various sensors’ false alarm rates). We evaluated fire alarm systems of different districts in the city, and predicted the credibility of fire alarm signals. Our paper won the first prize of 2022 China May Day Mathematical Contest in Modeling.

			    <dt><strong>Rescue the Countess, Umich EECS281 Data Structures and Algorithm, Sep 2022</strong></dt>
			    <dd> 
			    	I implemented Depth First Search and Breadth First Search algorithms to guide Marco of the Fungus Province, helping him rescue Countess Cherry captive in a dark, maze-like castle, using C++. 
			    </dd>

			    <dt><strong>The Walking Deadline, Umich EECS281 Data Structures and Algorithm, Oct 2022</strong></dt>
			    <dd>
			    	I implemented a zoombie shooting game based on a Priority Queue container, using C++.
			    </dd>

			    <dt><strong>SillyQL, Umich EECS281 Data Structures and Algorithm, Nov 2022</strong></dt>
			    <dd>
				    I wrote a C++ program to simulate a basic relational database with an interface based on a subset of a standard query language in C++, using Hash Table and Binary Search Tree.
				</dd>

				<dt><strong>among-us, Umich EECS281 Data Structures and Algorithm, Dec 2022</strong></dt>
				<dd>
					I implemented a C++ program to calculate a Minimum Spanning Tree using Prim algorithm, approximate a solution to the Travelling Salesperson Problem using heuristics, and calculate an optimal solution to the problem using a branch and bound algorithm.
